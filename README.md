# :zap: Interview & Practice Questions  
  
:rocket: In this repo, I store a selection of the assignments and questions I came across in the **real interviews** and I solved on the interview practice websites such as **Google Foobar** and **leet.com** (see [my profile](https://leetcode.com/hmy0hmy/))  
  
### :star2: Building Connect Four with React  
  
The assignment was to build [Connect Four] game in React. In addition to [my submission](https://github.com/hm-y/connect-4-via-React), I've been asked some questions in code review, such as:  
- How can we re-implement it for 3 players or bigger board?
- How can we add an undo feature?
- How to make it more efficient if played by high volume of people?
